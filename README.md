# Hardy-Cross
![progress](https://progress-bar.dev/60/ "progress")

Learned about the Hardy Cross method in my Water Resources class and the process was demonstrated with Excel. The process was time consuming and error prone due to how the direction of flow affects the calculation. 
I wanted to create a python script to:
1. Create a scalable way to solve Hardy Cross problems reguardless of complexity of size
2. Practice using functions and dictionaries in Python

Not complete yet but I am open to suggestions if anyone has any experience with either Hardy Cross or Python.
